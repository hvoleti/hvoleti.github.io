I am currently a Master's student in Computer Science at <a href = "https://www.concordia.ca/">Concordia University</a> , working at <a href = "https://theictlab.org/">Immersive and Creative Technologies Lab </a> with <a href = "https://poullis.org/">Prof. Dr. Charalambous Poullis </a>. My research focuses on applying deep reinforcement learning to human-computer interaction, specifically in optimizing user interface design for virtual reality.

Additionally, I am a researcher at Think Surgical (in collaboration with the lab), where I focus on computer vision, including 3D reconstruction and registration of medical data.

Before starting my graduate studies, I interned at the University of Cincinnati at the <a href = "https://www.prasathlab.com/"> Prasath Lab </a>, with <a href = "https://www.prasathlab.com/about/members/pi"> Prof. Dr. Surya Prasath </a> where my research focused on multimodal liver segmentation using deep learning models.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at <a href = "https://jntuh.ac.in/"> JNTUH </a>, where my undergraduate thesis focused on using LSTM and BERT for emoji prediction in sentences.
